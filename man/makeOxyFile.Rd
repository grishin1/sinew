\title{Inserts roxygen2 skeletons in file(s).}
\usage{
makeOxyFile(input = NULL, overwrite = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{character vector of path(s) to one or more .R files, a path to directory containing .R files, Default: NULL, opens system dialogue for files selection}

\item{overwrite}{When TRUE overwrites file(s), FALSE writes "Oxy"- prefixed files in the same directory, Default: FALSE}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to \code{makeOxygen}}
}
\value{
Nothing. Writes files with roxygen2 comments as a side effect
}
\description{
Applies \code{makeOxygen} function to all functions/dataframes in supplied file(s)
}
\details{
If an object cannot be found, asks to sourse the file.
Objects will be sourced into a temporary environment.
If the file already contains roxygen2 comments they will be deleted to avoid duplication.
Some functions may require attaching additional packages. For instance, if functions
were defined with purrr's \code{compose} or \code{partial} functions, omission of \code{purr::} in definitions will
require \code{library(purrr)} before proceding with \code{makeOxyFile}.
}
\examples{
 makeOxyFile() # default args, opens system file selection dialogue
 makeOxyFile("./myRfunctions/utils.R") # on one R file
 makeOxyFile("./myRfunctions/") # on all R files in directory
 myfields <- c("concept", "describeIn")
 makeOxyFile("./myRfunctions/utils.R", add_fields = myfields, cut = 5) # adds more fields to deafaults, passes "cut" to makeImport
